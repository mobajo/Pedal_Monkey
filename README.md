# PedalMonkey - bike trip planner

Instead of doing old school spreadsheet planning of stages and keeping track of possible accommodation nearby PedalMonkey gives you a head start by dividing the route and suggesting hotels.

This is a final project of the Le Wagon full stack coding bootcamp in Copenhagen made by Rob Mitchell, Niels Møller-Hansen and Morten Bang Jørgensen in November 2017.

Rails app generated with [lewagon/rails-templates](https://github.com/lewagon/rails-templates), created by the [Le Wagon coding bootcamp](https://www.lewagon.com) team.
